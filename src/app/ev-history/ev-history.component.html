            Mizzou Electric Racing, previously known as Mizzou Eco Racing, has been a university organization since 19XX. 
            During its tenure, the Eco Racing team was involved in building solar cars, hydrogen cars, and an electric 
            conversion of a Chevy S10.<br><br>The Solar Car competed annually in the American Solar Challenge, also known as 
            “Sunrayce,” where cars raced from Chicago to Los Angeles over a 10-day period. Mizzou Eco Racing transitioned to 
            building hydrogen cars in 20XX, competing in the Shell Eco-Marathon from year to year, and in 2017, they successfully 
            converted a Chevy S10 into an electric vehicle.<br><br>In 2022, Mizzou Eco Racing became Mizzou Electric Racing. Together 
            with Mizzou Racing, we moved from the basement of Naka Hall into a new shop in Lafferre Hall. In the same year, we 
            began the joint manufacturing of Mizzou’s very first Formula SAE Electric Vehicle.
