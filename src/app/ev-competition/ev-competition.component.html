      <h1>Formula SAE</h1>
      <p>
        "The Formula SAE competitions challenge teams of university undergraduate and graduate students 
        to conceive, design, fabricate, develop and compete with small, formula style vehicles. The 
        competition is an engineering education competition that requires performance demonstration of 
        vehicles in a series of events, both off track and on track against the clock. Each competition gives 
        teams the chance to demonstrate their creativity and engineering skills in comparison to teams from other 
        universities around the world."

        <h4>Technical Inspection</h4>
        <p>
            Every year FSAE releases rules that every team must follow. These rules dictate how each car is built, but every team has its own unique design. 
            The car goes through a rigorous technical inspection performed by industry professionals. This is where we earn our first three nose cone stickers 
            after passing mechanical, accumulator, and EV active technical inspections.

        <h4>Static Events & Presentations</h4>
        <p>
            After passing mechanical, accumulator, and EV active technical inspection, we must earn three more stickers: 
            tilt, rain, and brakes. For tilt test, with a driver sitting in the car, it is tilted up to 45 and then 60 degrees. 
            Industry professionals are checking that the car is okay structurally and it is safe for the driver. During the rain 
            test, the tractive system is active, the car is lifted, and is exposed to 2 minutes of water spray, monitored for 
            2 minutes, and then the electrical system must work correctly. The car then heads to brake testing. A driver will 
            fully accelerate and then lock all four tires without the car turning off. After receiving all stickers for these 
            events, we get to drive!<br><br>Our design and business presentations also happen during these static events. Our 
            team leads present their designs of the car to industry professionals and are ranked on a multitude of criteria. We 
            also present our business presentation during this time.

        <h3>Day 3</h3>
        <h4>Dynamic Events</h4>
        <p>
            This is when the driving begins! Drivers compete in three different driving events. Acceleration is similar to a drag race. 
            Skidpad is a figure eight testing the carâ€™s suspension capabilities. Autocross follows, this event qualifies teams for a 
            starting position in Endurance.  Each event has two drivers per team, and each driver gets two runs. This day is action-packed 
            and when all the hard work pays off!

        <h3>Day 4</h3>
        <h4>Endurance</h4>
        <p>
            The endurance event takes the entirety of the final day. Two drivers compete on the logest course of the competition. It is essentially 
            a larger version of the autocross race, Endurance tests how long the car is able to run, and cooling is often the biggest issue in this event.
