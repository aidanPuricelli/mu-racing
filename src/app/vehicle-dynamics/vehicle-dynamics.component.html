      <h3>What We Do...</h3>
      <p>
        Our vehicle dynamics team manufactures components in-house. The suspension package involves our springs, dampers, 
        anti-roll bars, push & pull rods, control arms, and tires. The suspension team is involved with all things tuning: 
        dampers, toe, camber, tire temperatures. Using this data and knowledge of vehicle dynamics, we make adjustments to 
        the car depending on the type of driving we are doing.

          <p>Aaron is a senior mechanical engineering major with a math minor. He joined the team in Fall 2021, 
            served as brakes & controls lead for two years and served as the teams president in 2023/24. During 
            this time Aaron began learning the art of vehicle dynamics. Aaron's design goals for this season 
            include a rear structure update, anti-roll bar redesign, and ensuring the car's quality and dependability.</p>
